gitintro-cheatsheet
===================
Hey!..

That's my utmost fledgling 1st attempt to commit and push files from a repo-initated directory to a specified repo in Github directly from Linux Ubuntu Terminal.
Cheatsheet contains intro instructions from SSH key help file and Derek Banas GIT video tutorials.
Hopefully, that helps the absolute beginner...!
